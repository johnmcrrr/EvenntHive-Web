                You know the scenario: A client books your full-service wedding package. Two months in, they're asking
                for "just one more venue walkthrough" and "a quick mock-up of the table settings." Before you know it,
                you've logged 8 unpaid hours—and they're surprised when you mention additional fees.

                working for free.
